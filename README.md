The app is using free version of the DeepL API so, we need to get DeepL API Key:
- Register on the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api)
- Copy API key from your profile (it will be ready after registration proccess)
- Insert the API key for the `PLASMO_PUBLIC_TRANSLATION_KEY=` .env field.
- If your key if for the free API version, set the `PLASMO_PUBLIC_IS_PRO` .env key to the false.

An example of the .env file can be found in the .env.example file

## Development Setup

- Install/Use correct node version (node 20.17):
  ```bash
    nvm install
    nvm use
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
    yarn
  ```
- Start the development server:
  ```bash
    yarn run dev
  ```
  Feel free to use npm / pnpm as well with `npm install` and `npm run dev`
  

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
yarn build
# or
npm run build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.

The easiest way to deploy your Plasmo extension is to use the built-in [bpp](https://bpp.browser.market) GitHub action. Prior to using this action however, make sure to build your extension and upload the first version to the store to establish the basic credentials. Then, simply follow [this setup instruction](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/submit) and you should be on your way for automated submission!
